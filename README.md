# üåê MBVST Optimization ‚Äì Optical Network Project

This repository contains code and results from a research project focused on solving the **Minimum Branch Vertices Spanning Tree (MBVST)** problem, a key challenge in optical network design.

## üìå Project Overview

The MBVST problem consists in finding a spanning tree of a given undirected graph while **minimizing the number of branching nodes** (nodes with degree > 2). This has direct applications in designing cost-efficient and robust optical networks.

We implemented and compared multiple approaches, including:

- Exact resolution via MILP formulations (Pulp + Cplex)
- Flow-based and Martin formulations
- Cycle basis heuristic
- Edge-level prediction using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forests**

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pulp, Cplex
- scikit-learn
- NetworkX, matplotlib

## üìà Results

- Flow-based MILP models significantly reduce resolution time on medium-to-large graphs
- Predictive models (F1 ~76%) successfully anticipate which edges belong to optimal solutions
- Hybrid approaches can guide heuristics with ML insights
